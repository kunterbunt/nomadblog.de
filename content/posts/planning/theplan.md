The idea's quite simple. 

1. Save money.
2. Buy a used car -- preferably a 4-wheel-drive.
3. Equip that car with a bed and things you need when you live in a car.
4. Learn how to repair said car.
5. Go drive east until you can't.

And meanwhile, write about it. Why? Mostly because I want to. I like reading other people's blogs, I like to be able to keep all friends and family up-to-date, and just maybe someone likes what I do.

The plan for this blog is to document my journey; first on the way of getting ready-to-go, and then the actual traveling. It seems to me many people want to do something similar: drop out of everyday life, get out there into the world and see it. What I don't see very often is literature or blogs on the specific *how's*. How do you plan for this? How do you finance this? What are the hurdles you come across?   
Other blogs either document their actual travels, which is fantastic. And some blogs write about the planning, but in a very general manner. So this one tries to follow the entire way of getting ready to go, and then the rest as well.

On a trip to Tanzania I have met a Swiss couple who has traveled for three years. They have spanned this planet, but used flight as method of transportation. That's too quick for me, I like travelling slowly. They could tell me that they've spent roughly 20.000 Euro per person for the entire trip. Let's break that down. $$\frac{20000 \, \text{Euro}}{36\,\text{months}} = 555\frac{\text{Euro}}{\text{month}}$$ 

Now that's not very much. I live off more right now. Actually, my rent is more than that. My theoretic road leads east from Germany -- things get cheaper there. With a car I save on accomodation and flight tickets, but in turn I burn some through gas. Frankly I have no idea how much money I *need*, but then again this is supposed to be an *indeterminately long trip*, so I just go on until I run out of motivation or money. So I'll just take the 20.000 Euro as a starting point.
