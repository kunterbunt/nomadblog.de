Hi, I'm Sebastian.
---
I live in the beautiful port city of Hamburg, in northern Germany.   
I am a research assistant by trade, and write about this life over at [syntaxsugar.de](https://syntaxsugar.de).

I have come to love the traveler's life when I did my first big trip at 19 when I went to Australia for a travel & work stay of 9 months. We would work and save money for a car, then drive that car some several thousand kilometers south and enjoy every moment of it.   

Since then I've made it a prime bucket list item to do an indefinite trip, and this blog documents my journey to achieving this life goal. :)
