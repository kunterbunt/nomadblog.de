              <p>Alright, so here I am. Sitting in my flat in Hamburg. What should one do with life? There&rsquo;s so many fascinating things to do, but one of them seems to beat all others: travel!<br />
For uncountably many years (okay, not that many, but quite a few) I have known that travelling is one of my most favourite pastimes. I have done a few trips, from three-week excursions to China to nine-month travel-and-work trips to Australia, and each and every time I came to love the freedom that travelling brings. Just getting out there and seeing the world&hellip;</p>

<p>So, this plan has been forming in my head for a while. The main goal is to travel for a very long time and see as much as possible, with as little planning as required. Plans don&rsquo;t work when travelling, you always end up meeting someone that tells you about this very cool place that you must see and suddenly you&rsquo;ve spent 2 weeks somewhere you didn&rsquo;t know had existed and all previous plans are rubbish now.</p>

<p>Working for money as you go is perfect for the just-out-of-school type, but only works in few specific countries (Australia, New Zealand and Canada usually). For what I have in mind it&rsquo;s not really an option. I certainly want to travel cheaply; I couldn&rsquo;t care less about luxury hotels, and I&rsquo;m happy to work for food and lodging for locals or cool projects (both of which are easy to find on the Internet, e.g. through <a href="https://www.helpx.net/">helpx.net</a>).</p>

<p>I would like to travel in my own car because of the flexibility it gives me - when the above-mentioned person tells me about this beautiful lake 2 hours from here in the middle of nowhere, then I want to be able to go there easily. And camp there easily. Travelling in a car means I have to start in Germany, but why not? Flying is bad for the environment anyway. Being in Germany, if I want to travel for a long while I kinda have to go east, so naturally the idea of the Silk Road, this ancient network of trade routes, comes to mind. As I said, little planning is intended, so deviating off is perfectly fine, but generally: go east on the paths the forefathers have taken. :)</p>

<p>The idea&rsquo;s quite simple.</p>

<ol>
<li>Save money.</li>
<li>Buy a used car &ndash; preferably a 4-wheel-drive.</li>
<li>Equip that car with a bed and things you need when you live in a car.</li>
<li>Learn how to repair said car.</li>
<li>Go drive east until you can&rsquo;t.</li>
</ol>

<p>And meanwhile, write about it. Why? Mostly because I want to. I like reading other people&rsquo;s blogs, I like to be able to keep all friends and family up-to-date, and just maybe someone likes what I do.</p>

<p>The plan for this blog is to document my journey; first on the way of getting ready-to-go, and then the actual traveling. It seems to me many people want to do something similar: drop out of everyday life, get out there into the world and see it. What I don&rsquo;t see very often is literature or blogs on the specific <em>how&rsquo;s</em>. How do you plan for this? How do you finance this? What are the hurdles you come across?<br />
Other blogs either document their actual travels, which is fantastic. And some blogs write about the planning, but in a very general manner. So this one tries to follow the entire way of getting ready to go, and then the rest as well.</p>

<p>On a trip to Tanzania I have met a Swiss couple who has traveled for three years. They have spanned this planet, but used flight as method of transportation. That&rsquo;s too quick for me, I like travelling slowly. They could tell me that they&rsquo;ve spent roughly 20.000 Euro per person for the entire trip. Let&rsquo;s break that down. $$\frac{20000 \, \text{Euro}}{36\,\text{months}} = 555\frac{\text{Euro}}{\text{month}}$$</p>

<p>Now that&rsquo;s not very much. I live off more right now. Actually, my rent is more than that. My theoretic road leads east from Germany &ndash; things get cheaper there. With a car I save on accomodation and flight tickets, but in turn I burn some through gas. Frankly I have no idea how much money I <em>need</em>, but then again this is supposed to be an <em>indeterminately long trip</em>, so I just go on until I run out of motivation or money. So I&rsquo;ll just take the 20.000 Euro as a starting point.</p>
