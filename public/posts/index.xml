      <description>How the heck do you save 20k (where does this figure come from?)? You make a plan&amp;hellip; I guess.
I work as a research assistant at a German university, my goal is to write a dissertation, get a PhD, and then I&amp;rsquo;m off. This has some advantages, as a) it pays quite well and b) it has an endpoint. In my case there is no fixed deadline, I am done when I am done.</description>

      <description>The idea&amp;rsquo;s quite simple.
 Save money. Buy a used car &amp;ndash; preferably a 4-wheel-drive. Equip that car with a bed and things you need when you live in a car. Learn how to repair said car. Go drive east until you can&amp;rsquo;t.  And meanwhile, write about it. Why? Mostly because I want to. I like reading other people&amp;rsquo;s blogs, I like to be able to keep all friends and family up-to-date, and just maybe someone likes what I do.</description>
